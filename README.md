## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
!> in index.html file we must add meta query tag
2> app.js file we must add player functions and enemy functions and also enemy and player objects
# AIM OF THE PROJECT:  

 To learn about object oriented java script and implement them in the arcade  Game project.

# WORKS FLOW

1. After the Clone of the project from github we have to run the html file in console.
2. the errors are resolved to get canvas in the browser .
3. The player and  enemies characters are created in app.js file.
4. the spanned enemies are given with random speed in which they move in x axis only.
4. the player will not move out of the canvas.
5. movements for the player are up, down, left, right are given to the player and the player restricted not to move outside of the canvas.
